      <h1>Confirmation Bias</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        When you were little and immature, have you ever disliked a person to an extent where you formulated double standards and disliked things that they did, even though those actions were acceptable when done by other people? Most people probably have. If you are one of them, you probably know the feedback loop that it causes. You dislike them, so what they do seems more unpleasant to you; because what they do seems unpleasant to you, you dislike them more. Without proper communication and understanding of each other, this loop is very difficult to escape from. This particular confirmation bias appears less as we mature, because we learn to be more understanding and accepting, and care less about other people's business.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Unfortunately, this open-mindedness only develops between people, not between people and ideas. Stubbornness is an innate characteristic of humans. When we were young, we used to believe that our ideas were right, or at least wanted them to be. We learned to be more accepting of other people, due to the societal standard expecting us to act that way. The inability to follow this norm would result in being labelled as “rude” and “egocentric”. However, there isn't a societal norm that expects us to be open-minded to <em>our own</em> ideas, and thus is rarely taught to us. Hence making us still very stubborn about our preferences.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Furthermore, the opportunity for us to learn to be open-minded to our own ideas is hampered by the societal norms of being empathetic. People don't make comments on our preferences since they are supposed to respect our perspectives. We often hear inspiration quotes like “Specialize in what you love” and “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment”. These quotes are theoretically helpful in life because they encourage us to do what we enjoy and be ourselves, but I believe that they are unrealistically optimistic. The problem with these quotes is that we don't know if what we currently love is the best thing for ourselves, nor can we be certain that we are already at the best that we can be, to stop learning from others and just truly be ourselves. Getting inspired by these quotes is dangerous. You might be blinding yourself from other options, by diving straight into your current preference and shutting the doors on everything else.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Again, we are all stubborn about our preferences. You might disagree with me and say that your preferences are definitive. Your disagreement is the reason why I am writing this blog. I want to create an alternate way of thinking about our preferences, with the hope that I can help people explore options that can potentially turn out to be better than their current preferences.
      </div>
      <h1>Opening your mind</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        To become mindful, recognizing your confirmation bias is the first step. First, think about your favourite course. Why do you like it? Is it because it is easy and you love the satisfaction of success? If it is, I would recommend exploring more options. There are likely other things with better reasons for you to enjoy. Think you already tried other options? Then what made you dislike them? Was it because they didn't make sense or felt useless? If that is the reason, I would encourage you to try them again, with optimism.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        We are always unconsciously making comparisons between our preferences. When we believe we have a preference, we eliminate our possibility of continuing to look for something else. For example, students always say “I'm more of a math person, I can't do art!”. When this happens, we become ignorant to the preferential features of other options. Over time, this inconspicuous feedback loop induces confirmation bias that makes us dislike those options.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Unlike the loop between other human beings, discussed in the beginning of the blog, we don't escape this loop as we mature. The only way to get away from it is to start all over with optimism. Only look at the favourable traits in things. The other traits won't matter because our ambition and determination will incentivize us to chase our goals regardless of the costs. When doing this, also pay careful attention to the satisfaction of fulfillment. You might intuitively like a subject from the initial fulfillment. However, this satisfaction can occur on every subject, and conversely, can fade away from the subject you like as it gets harder.

      <h1>My story</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In grade 11, I loved chemistry for the satisfaction of seeing my drudgery paying off in my grades. I disliked history since it was challenging for me to memorize the events and dates. I never even considered taking arts because not only did it not make sense to me, I also didn't see any pragmatic applications of it. Not to mention people were always talking about the difficulty of getting a job with an art degree. One day, my social teacher did his usual enlightenment to the class:
      </div>
      <div class="quote last">
        Sometimes, people tell me that they are more of a science person, and are not a social type of person. To them, I say: “Why not be both?”. You guys are still young. It is never too late to learn something. I didn't know how to say “Hello” in spanish until 23, and I am now a fluent spanish teacher.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        His message awoke me. Indeed, we are the only people limiting ourselves. Everyone around us is empathetic of our preferences. The only factors stopping us from trying is our stubbornness, fear of change, and confirmation bias. Although history is still not my favourite subject, I now see the benefits of taking it, and certainly don't dislike it anymore. This paradigm shift in perspective makes me more engaged in history classes, which facilitates me in learning and memorizing concepts that I found difficult. For art, my change in perspective was even greater. I became an aspiring art student after recognizing the level of thoughtfulness in artists' minds, and understood that art is more than just what we see on the canvas. Art involves perspectives, communication, mindfulness, and much more other pragmatic skills. On the other hand, chemistry became harder, and without that feeling of accomplishment, I realized that chemistry is not as interesting to me as I thought it was.
      </div>
      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Stubbornness, fear of change, and confirmation bias unconsciously hinder us from trying out subjects unfamiliar to us. However, we can and we should have multiple passions, instead of limiting ourselves to stick to just one. To mitigate this, be open to changes and new perspectives, and don't be afraid to try something you don't like. The time spent on learning a thing that you later find to be uninteresting is not a waste of time at all, it is a process of understanding yourself.
